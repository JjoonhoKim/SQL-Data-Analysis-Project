# SQL-Data-Analysis-Project
**Introduction**


Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the
world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime,
the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to
launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.


I have been hired as a data analyst by Rockbuster Stealth’s business intelligence (BI)
department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. The BI
department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related
queries. My first task is to load all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database
management system (RDBMS). Then, you’ll use SQL to analyze the data and answer any
ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have.

**Context**


In order to address the inquiries from different departments, I'll be utilizing SQL (structured query language) to query the data. Throughout this Achievement, I'll be gradually learning SQL and applying it to tackle progressively more intricate business questions in each task. The outcomes of my analysis will be presented to Rockbuster management, requiring me to visualize the data in an easily understandable manner. Essentially, I'll be building on my knowledge from previous Achievements. Despite working with data from the online video streaming industry, the skills I develop can be applied across various industries, showcasing my problem-solving abilities for diverse clients. The primary goal is to gain hands-on experience with SQL, allowing me to perform various query-based analyses by the end of the project.

**Key Questions and Objectives**


● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?

● What was the average rental duration for all videos?

● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
