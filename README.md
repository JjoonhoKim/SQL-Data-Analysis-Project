# SQL-Data-Analysis-Project
In the course of my SQL Project at CareerFoundry, I was entrusted with the responsibility of leveraging a relational database to analyze the operations of a fictitious film rental enterprise named "Rockbuster." Throughout this project, I skillfully employed a combination of database management using PostgreSQL, data visualization through Tableau, and data analysis via Microsoft Excel to craft a comprehensive report tailored for the senior management team of the organization.

The primary objective of this undertaking was to shed light on pivotal market trends and derive actionable insights, thereby contributing to the strategic growth and success of the company. Enclosed within this submission, you will find a PDF presentation, meticulously detailing our findings and recommendations. Additionally, a meticulously crafted data dictionary, outlining the structure and purpose of the database and its constituent tables, is included for your reference. For your convenience, an Excel workbook is also provided, encompassing all the SQL queries that were instrumental in deriving the insights presented in the report.
